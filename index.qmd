## 2. Uncertainty, existential dread, research project on cochlear implants in Australia, etc

![](index-img/250903-131613.avif){fig-align="center"}

## 3. PhD in a hospital on spinal cord injury - learnt to code!

The Setting
:::

## UKDRI

![](index-img/250903-133514.avif){fig-align="center"}

::: {.notes}
- over 600 people in the institute
- around 100 informaticians - many isolated and with no software/stats training
- strong appetite to collaborate and improve
:::

## Fellowship plan

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
1. Do the carpentries train the trainer
1. Deliver pilot training locally at Cardiff University - carpentries git course
    - Add on code review aspect
        - Assign attendees into code buddy pairs
        - Have them use GitHub template with documentation of how to conduct code reviews
        - Suggest weekly meeting to review code
:::

## Fellowship plan - continued

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
1. Get feedback on the pilot - incorporate and refine
1. Travel to the UKDRI centers to deliver the training
1. Build up network for folk to request code buddies
    - Favor connecting different centres to promote broader networking
:::

## The wins

::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
- Many folk not using version control -> delivering training should improve this
- Motivation to improve code quality (documentation, reproducibility, etc)
- Networking
- Support learning and development
- I gain lots of experience in training and community building!
